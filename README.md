# [Cube 3d](https://arturabdullin.github.io/cube3d/)
## About
Cube 3d is my pet project aimed at studying the ```transform``` CSS property capabilities and OOP paradigm.

It is a simple three dimentional cube assembled using six ```<div>``` elements and the ```transform``` property magic.

You can rotate the Cube using a mouse (v1.0). Rotation is realised using a homogeneous matrix transformation.
